TODO List

Always
- Watch out for PHP 5 incompatibilities!

1.0
- Integrate ConfigForm with filter configuration. Considerations:
  + CSS and JavaScript need to be integrated properly, CSS might look ugly
- Add warning note about caching
- Remove support for purifying on output; this is a no good, terrible idea
- Remove inbound filtering; this is user unfriendly and should be avoided
- Improve help text (this might be a good addition to the HTML Purifier
  core)
